<h3>Pingry COVID-19 Update</h3>
<h5>Your child has been identified as a close contact </h5>
<hr/>

<p>Dear Caregiver of <%= "#{@student.first_name}"%>,</p>

<p>Your child has been identified by Pingry’s Contact Tracing Team as having had close contact with a COVID-19 case on <%= @contact.exposure %>.</p>

<p>Due to the fact that your child is fully vaccinated or within a 90 day window of recovery from COVID-19, in accordance with guidance from the New Jersey Department of Health, your child:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Does not need to quarantine, be excluded from school, but should test following an exposure to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. <strong>Pingry’s weekly pool testing will satisfy this recommendation.</strong>/li>
    <li>Should self-monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 for 14 days following an exposure.</li>
</ul>

<p>As part of our contact tracing process, we seek to share the fact that your child has been identified as a close contact as quickly as possible, but we appreciate that a phone call will be helpful to process this information and ask clarifying questions.</p>

<p>If <%= "#{@student.first_name}"%> experiences any of the following symptoms, please reach out to your healthcare provider, notify them of your child’s vaccination status, and contact Pingry via email at <a href="mailto:contacttracing@pingry.org">contacttracing@pingry.org</a>:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Fever or chills</li>
    <li>Cough</li>
    <li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
    <li>Fatigue</li>
    <li>Muscle or body aches</li>
    <li>New loss of taste or smell</li>
    <li>Sore throat</li>
    <li>Congestion or runny nose</li>
    <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
    <li>Diarrhea</li>
</ul>

<p>Pingry respects your family’s privacy and will not be sharing information regarding <%= "#{@student.first_name}"%>’s close contact outside of our Contact Tracing Team. </p>

<p>We truly appreciate your cooperation in keeping the Pingry community safe. Please let us know if there is anything we can do to help support your family during this time.</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>The Pingry School</p>
