<p>Dear <%= "#{@student.first_name}"%>,</p>

<p>You have been identified by Pingry’s Contact Tracing Team as having had close contact with a COVID-19 case on <%= @quarantine.exposure %>. In order to minimize potential community transmission, <strong>you will need to enter a mandatory quarantine starting on <%= @quarantine.exposure %></strong>. There are two approved options to return to campus from <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/index.html'>quarantine.</a></p> 


<strong>Option 1: </strong>
<p>Quarantine at home for 10 days beginning <%= @quarantine.exposure %> and ending on <%= @quarantine.exposure + 10%>. Your earliest possible date of return to campus would be on <%= @quarantine.exposure + 11 %>.</p>

<strong>Option 2:</strong>
<p>Quarantine at home for a minimum of 5 days beginning <%= @quarantine.exposure %> and ending on <%= @quarantine.exposure + 5 %>. Your earliest possible day of return to campus would be on <%= @quarantine.exposure + 6 %> provided you meets all of the following criteria: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Remain asymptomatic for the duration of the quarantine period</li>
    <li>Submit a negative test result from a rapid antigen test — administered at home or by a physician and taken on or after day five of the isolation period — to the appropriate campus nurse and <a href="mailto:contacttracing@pingry.org">contacttracing@pingry.org</a>, including full name, date of birth, and date of test taken. Click <a href="https://www.pingry.org/hp/21-22-bettertogether/example-photo-test-result-rat">here</a> for an example.</li>
</ul>

<p>During this quarantine period, you are not permitted on Pingry’s campuses, at in-person Pingry events, or around Pingry community members at any time for any reason.</p>

<p><strong>Your immediate next steps are:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Contact Human Resources and</li>
    <li>Either your Division Director</strong> (and Department Chair for Basking Ridge Faculty) or your Direct Supervisor to discuss how and whether you can fulfill your employment duties while not on campus.
