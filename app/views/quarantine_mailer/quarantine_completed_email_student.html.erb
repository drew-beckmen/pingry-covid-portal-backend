<p>Dear Parent/Guardian of <%= "#{@student.first_name}"%>,</p>

<% if Date.today < @quarantine.exposure + 13 %>
<p>According to Pingry's records, your child was being quarantined in connection to a potential positive case resulting from Pingry's pool testing initiative. As a result of that potential positive case's independent re-testing with a negative result, <%= @student.first_name %>'s quarantine period ends today on <%= Date.today %> and <%= @student.first_name %> will be able to return to campus starting tomorrow on <%= Date.today + 1 %>.</p>
<% else %>
<p>According to Pingry's records, your child has completed the final day of their quarantine today on <%= Date.today %> and will be able to return to campus starting tomorrow on <%= Date.today + 1%>.</p>
<% end %>

<p>If your child has developed symptoms or tested positive for COVID-19 during their quarantine, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contacttracing@pingry.org">contacttracing@pingry.org</a>.</p>

<p>We ask that you inform Pingry if your child will be switching from a remote learner to an in-person learner by emailing the appropriate divisional attendance email:</p>
