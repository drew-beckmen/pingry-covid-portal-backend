<h3>Pingry COVID-19 Update</h3>
<h5>Notice of transfer to isolation protocol</h5>
<hr/>

<p>Dear Parent/Guardian of <%= "#{@student.first_name}"%>,</p>

<p>We are sorry to hear about <%= @student.first_name %>’s positive COVID-19 diagnosis and the resulting change in their quarantine status.</p>

<p>This email confirms that your child has been identified as either a presumed positive (i.e., from known exposure and symptoms) or confirmed positive (i.e., from test results) COVID-19 case and will be entering a mandatory 10-day-minimum isolation period.</p>

<p>If your child is symptomatic, your child will need to be fever-free for at least 24 hours without the use of fever suppressants and show improvement of symptoms before being released from isolation. We will be periodically checking in with you and your child during your child’s isolation. During this isolation period, your child is not permitted on Pingry campuses or at in-person Pingry events.</p>

<p>A member of the Pingry Contact Tracing Team will be calling you shortly to conduct a contact tracing interview and connect on next steps. If you do not receive a call within the next 24 hours, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:contacttracing@pingry.org">contracttracing@pingry.org</a>. It is essential that you connect with our Contact Tracing Team to help minimize potential community spread.</p>

<p>If your child feels able to attend classes, they may engage as a remote learner in Pingry Anywhere. Please reach out to your child’s Division Director for any additional support needed for your child to participate as a remote learner in Pingry Anywhere.</p>

<p>If you have updates regarding your child’s status, please email us at <a href="mailto:contacttracing@pingry.org">contracttracing@pingry.org</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you for your partnership as we work to keep Pingry safe! You may receive more information from your local health department for additional contact tracing efforts.</p>

<p>Best wishes for a speedy recovery,</p>
<p>The Pingry School</p>
