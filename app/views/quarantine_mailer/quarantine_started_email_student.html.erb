<h3>Pingry COVID-19 Update</h3>
<h5>Your child has just entered a quarantine period</h5>
<hr/>

<p>Dear Parent/Guardian of <%= "#{@student.first_name}"%>,</p>

<p>Your child has been identified by Pingry’s Contact Tracing Team as having had close contact (i.e., within 6 feet for more than 10 minutes during the 3 days prior to a case’s isolation) with a COVID-19 case on <%= @quarantine.exposure %>.</p>

<p>In order to minimize potential community transmission, <strong>your child will need to enter a mandatory 14-day quarantine starting on <%= @quarantine.exposure %> and ending on <%= @quarantine.exposure + 14 %></strong>. Your child’s earliest possible date of return to campus is on <%= @quarantine.exposure + 15 %>, regardless of a physician’s clearance and/or a negative result from a COVID-19 test.  During this quarantine period, your child is not permitted on Pingry campuses or at in-person Pingry events.</p>

<p>Please monitor your child for any symptoms of COVID-19. If <%= @student.first_name %> experiences any of the following symptoms, please reach out to your healthcare provider and notify us via email at <a href="mailto:contacttracing@pingry.org">contacttracing@pingry.org</a>:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Fever or chills</li>
    <li>Cough</li>
    <li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
    <li>Fatigue</li>
    <li>Muscle or body aches</li>
    <li>New loss of taste or smell</li>
    <li>Sore throat</li>
    <li>Congestion or runny nose</li>
    <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
    <li>Diarrhea</li>
</ul>

<p>We will be in touch several times throughout the duration of <%= @student.first_name %>’s quarantine to check in as well. All information is confidential and will only be shared as needed within Pingry’s Contact Tracing Team. We ask that you inform Pingry that your child will be participating as a remote learner in <a href="https://pingryanywhere.org/">Pingry Anywhere</a> for the duration of their quarantine by emailing the appropriate divisional attendance email:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Lower School: <a href="mailto:lsattendance@pingry.org">lsattendance@pingry.org</a>  + your child's homeroom teacher</li>
    <li>Middle School: <a href="mailto:msattendance@pingry.org@pingry.org">msattendance@pingry.org</a> </li>
    <li>Upper School: <a href="usattendance@pingry.org">usattendance@pingry.org</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In the situation that your child’s quarantine is linked to a potentially positive COVID-19 case (i.e., COVID-19 DETECTED pair from Pingry’s weekly testing with Mirimus), we will update you appropriately if the case is cleared and your child is permitted to return to campus.</p>

<p>We truly appreciate your cooperation in keeping the Pingry community safe. You may also be contacted by the local Department of Health. Please let us know if there is anything we can do to help support your family during this time.</p>

<p>Thank you for your help in keeping Pingry safe!</p>
<p>The Pingry School</p>
