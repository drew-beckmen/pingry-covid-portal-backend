<h5>Your child has just entered a quarantine period</h5>
<hr/>

<p>Dear Parent/Guardian of <%= "#{@student.first_name}"%>,</p>

<p>Your child has been identified by Pingry’s Contact Tracing Team as having had close contact with a COVID-19 case on <%= @quarantine.exposure %>. In order to minimize potential community transmission, <strong>your child will need to enter a mandatory quarantine starting on <%= @quarantine.exposure %></strong>. There are three approved options to return to campus from <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/index.html'>quarantine.</a></p> 



<strong>Option 1: Traditional Quarantine</strong>
<p>Quarantine at home for 10 days beginning <%= @quarantine.exposure %> and ending on <%= @quarantine.exposure + 10%>. <%= "#{@student.first_name}"%>’s earliest possible date of return to campus would be on <%= @quarantine.exposure + 11 %>. During this quarantine period, your child is not permitted on Pingry’s campuses, at in-person Pingry events, or around Pingry community members.</p>

<strong>Option 2: Abbreviated At-Home Quarantine</strong>
<p>Quarantine at home for a minimum of five days beginning <%= @quarantine.exposure %> and ending on <%= @quarantine.exposure + 5 %>. <%= "#{@student.first_name}"%>’s earliest possible day of return to campus would be on <%= @quarantine.exposure + 6 %> provided your child meets all of the following criteria: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Remains asymptomatic for the duration of the quarantine period</li>
    <li>Submit a negative test result from a rapid antigen test — administered at home or by a physician and taken on or after day five of the isolation period — to the appropriate campus nurse and ContactTracing@pingry.org, including full name, date of birth, and date of test taken. Click <a href="https://www.pingry.org/hp/21-22-bettertogether/example-photo-test-result-rat">here</a> for an example.</li>
    <li><strong>Wear a mask while on campus between <%= @quarantine.exposure + 6 %> and <%= @quarantine.exposure + 10 %>.</strong></li>
    <li>During this quarantine period, your child is not permitted on Pingry’s campuses, at in-person Pingry events, or around Pingry community members.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Option 3: Test to Stay</strong>
<p><%= "#{@student.first_name}"%> may return to school immediately provided the following criteria are met: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Your child is currently asymptomatic and must remain asymptomatic for 10-days following their close contact.</li>
    <li>Your child must submit <strong>two negative test results</strong> from at-home rapid antigen tests. The first test must be administered, submitted, and approved in advance of the next school day. The second test must be administered, submitted, and approved on <%= @quarantine.exposure + 5 %>. Test results should be submitted to the appropriate campus nurse and ContactTracing@pingry.org, including full name, date of birth, and date that the test was taken. Click <a href="https://www.pingry.org/hp/21-22-bettertogether/example-photo-test-result-rat">here</a> for an example.</li>
    <li>Your child must wear a mask while on campus until <%= @quarantine.exposure + 6 %>.</li>
    <li>Your child may not participate in extracurricular activities until <%= @quarantine.exposure + 6 %>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your child’s vaccination records are not up to date, uploaded and approved by the time you receive this notification, your child’s quarantine options will remain unchanged until our school nurses approve their vaccination records. This process may take up to one business day.</p>
