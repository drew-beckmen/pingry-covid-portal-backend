<h3>Pingry COVID-19 Update</h3>
<h5>Your child has started an isolation period.</h5>
<hr/>

<p>Dear Parent/Guardian of <%= "#{@student.first_name}"%>,</p>

<p>The Pingry School has been notified that your child has been identified as one of two individuals in a potentially positive pair resulting from Pingry’s weekly COVID-19 testing. Your child will enter a <strong>mandatory isolation starting on <%= @isolation.start_isolation %></strong>.</p>

<p>You will have two options for your child’s attendance at school. Your child may either: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Continue the <strong>mandatory 10-day-minimum isolation starting on <%= @isolation.start_isolation %> and ending at the earliest on <%= @isolation.start_isolation + 10%></strong>. Your child’s earliest possible date of return to campus would be on <%= @isolation.start_isolation + 11 %>. During this isolation period, your child is not permitted on Pingry campuses or at in-person Pingry events. Please reach out to your child’s Division Director for any additional support needed for your child to participate as a remote learner in Pingry Anywhere for the duration of their isolation; or</li>
    <li>Submit results from an independent PCR test administered within the next 48 hours.  Testing sites can be found <a href="https://covid19.nj.gov/pages/testing#test-sites">here</a>. The cost of this test would be your responsibility, but most medical plans cover COVID-19 tests at 100%.  We encourage you to take this step as soon as possible, since a negative result from a PCR test administered within 48 hours will clear both your child’s isolation status as well as the quarantine status of anyone with whom they came in contact, and allow them to return to campus.  Until you are able to submit a negative test, your child should not return to campus and isolate as described in Scenario 1 above. For Short Hills students, please submit test results to <a href="mailto:pedell@pingry.org">Paula Edell</a>. For Basking Ridge students, please submit test results to <a href="mailto:jdibiasi@pingry.org">Jennifer DiBiasi</a> and <a href="mailto:jlivak@pingry.org">Joy Livak</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>A member of the Pingry Contact Tracing Team will be calling you shortly to conduct a contact tracing interview and connect on next steps. If you do not receive a call within the next 24 hours, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:contacttracing@pingry.org">contacttracing@pingry.org</a>. It is essential that you connect with our Contact Tracing Team to help minimize potential community spread.</p>

<p>If your child becomes symptomatic (e.g., fever, sore throat, uncontrolled cough, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, severe headache), please notify us immediately. Your child must also be fever-free for at least 24 hours without the use of fever suppressants and show improvement of symptoms before being released from isolation. We will be periodically checking in with you and your child during your child’s isolation. If you have updates regarding your child’s status, please email us at <a href="mailto:contacttracing@pingry.org">contacttracing@pingry.org</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you for your partnership as we work to keep Pingry safe!</p>
