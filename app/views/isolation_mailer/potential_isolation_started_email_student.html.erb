<h3>Pingry COVID-19 Update</h3>
<hr/>

<p>Dear Caregiver of <%= "#{@student.first_name}"%>,</p>


<p>The Pingry School has been notified that your child has been identified as one of two individuals in a potentially positive pair resulting from Pingry’s weekly COVID-19 testing. Until we can determine your child’s individual result, your child must isolate immediately starting on <%= @isolation.start_isolation %>. During this isolation period, your child is not permitted on Pingry campuses, in-person Pingry events, or around Pingry community members at any time for any reason.</p>

<p>To retrieve your child’s individual diagnostic result from their testing sample, Pplease immediately click on this <a href="https://mirimus.com/diagnostics">link</a>  to register and have your results read. To complete the registration process, you will need to enter your vial barcode number, which is <%= @isolation.barcode %>. A member of the Pingry Contact Tracing Team is on hand to assist you through the process if needed. <strong>Please forward the resulting reporting to <a href="mailto:contacttracing@pingry.org">contacttracing@pingry.org</a> immediately upon receipt. If the report details that COVID-19 is NOT DETECTED in your sample, your isolation will be released. If the report details that COVID-19 is DETECTED, our Contact Tracing Team will schedule a call at your earliest immediately available time, preferably within an hour of learning of the results.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If your child becomes symptomatic (e.g., fever, sore throat, uncontrolled cough, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, severe headache), please notify us immediately.</strong> We will be periodically checking in with you and your child during your child’s isolation. If you have updates regarding your child’s status, please email us at <a href="mailto:contacttracing@pingry.org">contacttracing@pingry.org</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you for your partnership as we work to keep Pingry safe!</p>
<p>The Pingry School</p>
