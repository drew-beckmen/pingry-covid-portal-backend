<h3>Pingry COVID-19 Update</h3>
<h5>Your child has started an isolation period.</h5>
<hr/>

<p>Dear Parent/Guardian of <%= "#{@student.first_name}"%>,</p>

<p>The Pingry School has been notified that your child has been identified as one of two individuals in a potentially positive pair resulting from Pingry’s weekly COVID-19 testing. Until we can determine your child’s individual result, <strong>your child must isolate immediately starting on <%= @isolation.start_isolation %></strong>.</p>

<p>For your family’s convenience and peace of mind, Pingry has partnered with a third party physicians group that can re-test your child’s original sample and provide a diagnostic result within hours of registration. Click on this <a href="https://covid-app.meenta.io/pooling/m1gT7fzM14Rny1dtrp7C">link</a> to register for an account with this partner and  have your results read. To begin the registration process, you will need to enter your vial barcode number which is <strong><%= @isolation.barcode %></strong>. A detailed guide on how to register can be found attached to this email. A member of the Pingry Contact Tracing Team is on hand to assist you through the process if needed. Please forward the resulting reporting to <a href="mailto:contacttracing@pingry.org">contacttracing@pingry.org</a> immediately upon receipt. <strong>If the report details that Covid-19 is NOT DETECTED in your sample, your isolation will be released. If the report details that Covid-19 is DETECTED, our Contact Tracing team will schedule a call at your earliest immediately available time, preferably within an hour of learning of the results.</strong></p>

<p>If your child becomes symptomatic (e.g., fever, sore throat, uncontrolled cough, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, severe headache), please notify us immediately. We will be periodically checking in with you and your child during your child’s isolation. If you have updates regarding your child’s status, please email us at <a href="mailto:contacttracing@pingry.org">contacttracing@pingry.org</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you for your partnership as we work to keep Pingry safe!</p>
<p>The Pingry School</p>
