<h3>Pingry COVID-19 Update</h3>
<h5>Your child has started an isolation period.</h5>
<hr/>

<p>Dear Parent/Guardian of <%= "#{@student.first_name}"%>,</p>

<p>The Pingry School has been notified that your child has been identified as one of two individuals in a potentially positive pair resulting from Pingry’s weekly COVID-19 testing. Until we can determine your child’s individual result, <strong>your child must isolate immediately starting on <%= @isolation.start_isolation %></strong>.</p>

<p>For your family’s convenience and peace of mind, Pingry has partnered with a third party physicians group that can re-test your child’s original sample and provide a diagnostic result within hours of registration. We strongly recommend you take advantage of this offering. To register: </p>

<p>Click on this <a href="https://covid-app.meenta.io/pooling/m1gT7fzM14Rny1dtrp7C">link</a> to have your child's sample re-reviewed. To begin the registration process you will need to enter your child's vial barcode number which is <em><%= @isolation.barcode %></em>. A detailed guide on how to register can be found attached to this email. A member of the Pingry Contact Tracing Team is on hand to assist you through the process if needed.</p>

<p>There are two other options for your child’s attendance:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Continue the <strong>mandatory 10-day-minimum isolation starting on <%= @isolation.start_isolation %> and ending at the earliest on <%= @isolation.start_isolation + 9 %></strong>. Your child’s earliest possible date of return to campus would be on <%= @isolation.start_isolation + 10 %>. During this isolation period, your child is not permitted on Pingry campuses or at in-person Pingry events at any time for any reason.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Please reach out to your child’s Division Director for any additional support needed for your child to participate as a remote learner in Pingry Anywhere for the duration of their isolation; or</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Submit results from an independent PCR test administered within the next 48 hours.  Testing sites can be found <a href="https://covid19.nj.gov/pages/testing#test-sites">here</a>.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Any individuals experiencing difficulty accessing additional COVID-19 testing are recommended to reach out to <a href="mailto:golvera@pingry.org">Gilberto Olvera</a>, Director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. The cost of this test would be your responsibility, but most medical plans cover COVID-19 tests at 100%. If your family receives financial aid and would like to have more guidance and support for your situation, please reach out to <a href="mailto:sschifano@pingry.org">Samantha Schifano</a> Director of Financial Aid.</li>
            <li>For Short Hills students, please submit test results to <a href="mailto:pedell@pingry.org">Paula Edell</a>. For Basking Ridge students, please submit test results to <a href="mailto:jdibiasi@pingry.org">Jennifer DiBiasi</a> and <a href="mailto:jlivak@pingry.org">Joy Livak</a>.</li>

<p>If your child becomes symptomatic (e.g., fever, sore throat, uncontrolled cough, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, severe headache), please notify us immediately. Your child must also be fever-free for at least 24 hours without the use of fever suppressants and show improvement of symptoms before being released from isolation. We will be periodically checking in with you and your child during your child’s isolation. If you have updates regarding your child’s status, please email us at <a href="mailto:contacttracing@pingry.org">contacttracing@pingry.org</a>.</p>
