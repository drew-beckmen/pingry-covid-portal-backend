<h3>Pingry COVID-19 Update</h3>
<h5>You have started an isolation period.</h5>
<hr/>

<p>Dear <%= "#{@student.first_name}"%>,</p>


<p>The Pingry School has been notified that you have been identified as one of two individuals in a potentially positive pair resulting from Pingryâ€™s weekly COVID-19 testing. As a result, you will enter a mandatory isolation starting on <%= @isolation.start_isolation %>.</p>

<p>You will then have two options. You may either:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Continue the <strong>mandatory 10-day-minimum isolation starting on <%= @isolation.start_isolation %> and ending at the earliest on <%= @isolation.start_isolation + 10%></strong>. Your earliest possible date of return to campus is on <%= @isolation.start_isolation + 11 %>. During this isolation period, you are not permitted on Pingry campuses or at in-person Pingry events; or</li>
    <li>Submit results from an independent PCR test administered within the next 48 hours.  Testing sites can be found <a href="https://covid19.nj.gov/pages/testing#test-sites">here</a>. The cost of this test would be your responsibility, but most medical plans cover COVID-19 tests at 100%.  We encourage you to take this step as soon as possible, since a negative result from a PCR test administered within 48 hours will clear both your isolation status as well as the quarantine status of anyone with whom you came in contact, and allow you to return to campus.  Until you are able to submit a negative test, you should not return to campus and isolate as described in scenario 1 above. Short Hills employees should submit their test results to <a href="mailto:pedell@pingry.org">Paula Edell</a>. Basking Ridge employees should submit their test results to <a href="mailto:jdibiasi@pingry.org">Jennifer DiBiasi</a> and <a href="mailto:jlivak@pingry.org">Joy Livak</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>In either scenario, please immediately:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Contact Human Resources and</li>
    <li>Either your Division Director (and Department Chair for Basking Ridge Faculty) or your Direct Supervisor to discuss how and whether you can fulfill your employment duties while not on campus. The Contact Tracing Team will not directly pass this information on to these individuals on your behalf.</li>
</ol>

<p>A member of the Pingry Contact Tracing Team will be calling you shortly to conduct a contact tracing interview and connect on next steps. If you do not receive a call within the next 24 hours, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:contacttracing@pingry.org">contacttracing@pingry.org</a>. It is essential that you connect with our Contact Tracing Team to help minimize potential community spread.</p>

<p>Please notify us at <a href="mailto:contacttracing@pingry.org">contacttracing@pingry.org</a> immediately of any changes to your status, including if you become symptomatic (e.g., fever, sore throat, uncontrolled cough, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, severe headache).</p>
