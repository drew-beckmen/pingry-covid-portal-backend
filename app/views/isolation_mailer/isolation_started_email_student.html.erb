<h3>Pingry COVID-19 Update</h3>
<h5>Your child has started an isolation period.</h5>
<hr/>

<p>Dear Parent/Guardian of <%= "#{@student.first_name}"%>,</p>

<p>Thank you for notifying Pingry regarding <%= @student.first_name %>’s positive COVID-19 diagnosis. Your willingness to share this information will help ensure we continue to keep our community safe. Our wishes are for <%= @student.first_name %> to have a speedy and restful recovery. </p>


<p>According to the information on file, <strong>your child entered a mandatory 10-day-minimum isolation starting on <%= @isolation.start_isolation %> and ending at the earliest on <%= @isolation.start_isolation  + 9 %></strong>. Your child’s earliest possible date of return to campus is on <%= @isolation.start_isolation  + 10 %>. If your child is symptomatic, your child will need to be fever-free for at least 24 hours without the use of fever suppressants and show improvement of symptoms before being released from isolation. We will be periodically checking in with you and your child during your child’s isolation. During this isolation period, your child is not permitted on Pingry campuses or at in-person Pingry events at any time for any reason.</p>


<p>A member of the Pingry Contact Tracing Team will be calling you shortly to conduct a contact tracing interview and connect on next steps. If you do not receive a call within the next 24 hours, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:contacttracing@pingry.org">contacttracing@pingry.org</a>. It is essential that you connect with our Contact Tracing Team to help minimize potential community spread.</p>

<p>The Contact Tracing team will be in touch several times throughout the duration of <%= @student.first_name %>’s isolation to check in as well. All information is confidential and will only be shared as needed within Pingry’s Contact Tracing Team. We respect your family’s privacy and will not be sharing this information broadly with members of Pingry’s community (including advisors, homeroom teachers, coaches, etc.). You are, of course, welcome to share details about your absence from school if you would like there to be better clarity or transparency regarding the absence, but you are not required to do so. </p>

<p>If your child feels able to attend classes, they may engage as a remote learner in Pingry Anywhere. Please reach out to your child’s Division Director for any additional support needed for your child to participate as a remote learner in Pingry Anywhere.</p>

<p>If you have updates regarding your child’s status, please email us at <a href="mailto:contacttracing@pingry.org">contacttracing@pingry.org</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you for your partnership as we work to keep Pingry safe! You may receive more information from your local health department for additional contact tracing efforts.</p>
