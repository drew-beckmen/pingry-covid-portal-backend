<hr/>

<p>Dear Parent/Guardian of <%= "#{@student.first_name}"%>,</p>

<p>According to Pingry's records, your child is currently in an isolation period due to being<strong>   
    <% if @isolation.confirmed %>
        <%= "confirmed positive" %>
    <% elsif @isolation.potential %>
        <%= "potentially positive" %>
    <% else %>
        <%= "presumed positive" %>
    <% end %> </strong>for COVID-19. Thank you for your recent update on your child’s isolation status.
</p>

<p>Please note that your child will only be permitted to return to campus once all documentation from your child's physician has been updated in the Magnus Health Portal (Coronavirus - COVID-19 Clearance), their "Overall Status" field reads "Isolation Complete," and you receive a call from one of our school nurses approving <%= @student.first_name%>’s return to campus. If there are any additional updates to your child’s isolation status, please contact <a href="mailto:contacttracing@pingry.org">contacttracing@pingry.org</a>.</p>

<p>Your child’s current status is <strong>isolation incomplete with an earliest possible return date of <%= @isolation.end_date ? @isolation.end_date + 1 : "not yet listed" %></strong>.</p>

<p>Thank you for your partnership as we work to keep Pingry safe!</p>
